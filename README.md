#Tracker-Catalog

A simple catalog app built with SwiftUI (iOS 16+) that allows users to browse, search, and view device details.

Requirements: iOS 16+ Xcode 15+

Getting Started: -Clone the repository -Open the project in Xcode -Ensure mock_items.json is added to the app target -Build and run on simulator or device

Architecture: -The app follows MVVM with a simple service layer: -Views: SwiftUI UI components -ViewModels: Manage state and business logic -Services: APIService (networking via URLSession + async/await) FavoritesService (UserDefaults persistence)

Networking: -Uses URLSession with async/await -JSON decoded using Codable with ISO8601 date handling -Mock API via URLProtocol using local JSON (mock_items.json)

State Handling: -The UI handles: -Loading -Success -Empty results -Error states

Trade-offs -Used UserDefaults for simplicity -Used a mock API layer to keep the app self-contained

Testing Includes minimal tests for: JSON decoding Favorites logic

Notes

The app uses a mock URL host (https://tracker.local) intercepted by URLProtocol.
This keeps the data layer realistic (URLSession-based) while still being local and self-contained.
Add mock_items.json to your app target resources in Xcode.
